# Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem Solving Patterns Practice

This repository is dedicated to my practice of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving patterns. It serves as a collection of various coding exercises and solutions that I've worked on to enhance my understanding and proficiency in these areas.

The repository is organized into several folders, each focusing on a specific topic:

- `datastructures`: This folder contains implementations of various data structures.
- `sorting`: This folder includes different sorting algorithms.
- `search`: This folder is dedicated to various search algorithms.
- `problem-solving-patterns`: This folder contains solutions to problems using different problem-solving patterns.
- `recursive`: This folder includes problems solved using recursive algorithms.
- `leetcode`: This folder contains solutions to problems from the [Grind75 list](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) on LeetCode.
- `utils`: This folder contains various utility functions that are used across different solutions.

Each solution is implemented with a focus on writing clean, efficient code, and includes unit tests to ensure correctness.

# Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

# Running Unit Tests

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies, you can validate the solutions by running the unit tests. Here's how:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Execute the unit tests by running the command `npm test`.

In addition to the standard test run: 

- **Watch Mode**: If you want to run the tests in watch mode `npm run test:watch`.
- **Coverage Report**: To generate a coverage report that shows how much of your code is covered by the tests `npm run test:coverage`
- **Verbose Mode**: For a more detailed output of your test run `npm run test:verbose`. This will display the names and statuses of individual tests as they are run.
